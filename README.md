# Learning Notes

Here you can explore the notes I took on posts I read, talks I watch, articles I study, and papers I love – recalling them right afterward by creating short summaries – helps a lot in my learning process. Here you'll find some of those little pieces.

Taking notes slows down quite a lot the amount of stuff I can ingest, but I found out it really helps me retain knowledge in the long-term. It allows me to come back, review and even share concepts that could be long forgotten otherwise, the slow intake trade-off is compensated.
