# Learning Notes

Taking notes on books I read, talks I watch, articles I study, and papers I love – recalling them right afterward by creating short summaries – helps a lot in my learning process. Here you'll find some of those little pieces.

If you are looking for an easy way to consume these notes, please check out [Aman-0604.github.io/learning-notes/](https://Aman-0604.github.io/learning-notes/).
