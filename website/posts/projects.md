# Projects

Ok, so here we are with the most important post of the century (for freshers obviously :))

Projects is the most important section in a freshers resume. This section doesn't just introduce you to the recruiter but proves your worth to them. 

> Nike says *Just Do It*, I say *Just Show It*

Here are some **project ideas** which I feel are cool and worth investing time on: 

### Simple

- TODO App
- 2048 Game (Fun yeah!)
- Tic Tac Toe Game

### Fundamental

- API Hub (Best Experience)
- Bank Operations
- Sorting Algorithm Visualiser
- CPU Scheduler (OS Concepts unlocked)
- Chess (OOPS Concepts unlocked)

### AI Based (use free Gemini API)

- Finance Assistant
- Movie Recommendation
- Resume Manager
- Resume Scorer (ATS Score)

### AI Agents (Agno is a lifesaver)

- Wealth Manager
- ITR Filer
- Web Scraper
- Job Searcher (and notify you every day)
- Dummy Dataset Generator (very very helpful)

### Miscellaneous

- LLM
- Overleaf MCP Server
- Something CI/CD Based
- Desktop App (maybe using electron)
- Chrome Extensions
- Own Web Browser

> Fun Fact: API Revolution came earlier and now it's time for MCP Revolution
