# Big O

- Big O tells how much slower a code gets as the input increases.
- There are best, average, and worst cases for a specific algorithm.
- Also there are Big Os for time, memory, and storage efficiency.
- Big O helps to understand which data structures or algorithms have better performance.
- Big O shows the growth rate and not the actual speed. So it's important to test the input data.
