# Resume Guide

Resume... no introduction needed. So let's get started.

> Keep one thing in mind, we make resumes for machines not for humans :)

## Keypoints to remember
- Never make resume on Canva. It's not ATS friendly. Always use word or overleaf(or any LaTex editor).
- Try to include numbers in every line. It increases ATS score.
- Bullet points should be small and plenty enough to not make your resume short or lengthy.
- Always start bullet points with strong action verbs.
- Highlight important points. 
- No spelling mistakes please.
- Always provide links, it acts as a proof.
- It should be of 1 page for freshers, and of 2 pages for experienced. 

## Where to make one ?
[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) is your friend in this case. There are plenty of templates available over there. But my favourite ones are: 
1. [Template 1](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/jakes-resume/syzfjbzwjncs)
2. [Template 2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oabOopXNdkq-pqXLiByFckQHNvtk7Wxy/view)


## Some action verbs for reference :
