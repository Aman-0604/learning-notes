# Performance Optimization

## Lighthouse Score

A Lighthouse score, is a metric generated by Google's Lighthouse tool to assess the performance of a website. It's a numerical value ranging from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better performance. Lighthouse analyzes various aspects of a webpage, including l*oading speed*, *responsiveness*, and *accessibility*, and combines these into a single performance score. 

## We can improve the lighthouse score of the homepage by leveraging these techniques: 

1. **Image format optimization (.webp, SVGs, no srcset)**

- .webp is a modern image format that provides superior compression than JPEG or PNG.
- SVGs are resolution-independent, perfect for logos/icons—no quality loss at any size.
- srcset helps in responsive images, but if your layout doesn’t need varying sizes for different screens, it’s unnecessary.

> *Reduces download size significantly → faster load → better Lighthouse Performance score.*

> *Less layout shift → better Lighthouse CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) score.*

2. **Lazy load heavy elements (e.g., editors, demo sections)**

- Don’t load large components (like a code editor or demo section) immediately on page load.
- Instead, detect when they’re near the viewport (using Intersection Observer or libraries) and load them just in time.

> *Keeps initial JS payload small → faster Time to Interactive.*

> *Lighthouse prioritizes what’s above-the-fold → delays loading what’s not immediately needed.*

3. **Static Site Generation (SSG) beats Server Side Rendering (SSR)**

- SSG (Static Site Generation) = HTML is pre-rendered at build time and served instantly via CDN.
- SSR (Server Side Rendering) = HTML is rendered on-the-fly on every request.

> *SSG pages are lightning fast, no server processing → excellent First Contentful Paint & Time to First Byte.*

> *SSR can be slower, especially under load or if backend APIs are slow.*

4. **Lazy load below-the-fold content**

- Split long pages and lazy load content that’s not visible initially, like testimonials, FAQs, or footer carousels.

> *Reduces initial DOM size, initial render time, and improves Largest Contentful Paint.*

> *Improves Lighthouse Accessibility score if long DOM trees are reduced.*

5. **Code splitting**

- In React.js or Next.js, each page gets its own JS bundle. So visiting /about won’t load /contact.js.

> *Keeps homepage JS bundle small → fast load → better JS execution time.*

> *Great for large websites with multiple routes.*
