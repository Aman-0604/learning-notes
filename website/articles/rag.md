# RAG

> RAG is Retrieval Augmented Generation

RAG is an innovative approach in the field of NLP that combines the strength of 2 models i.e retrieval based model and generation based model to enhance the quality of generated text. 

> Eg. You give prompt to say ChatGPT and it gives you response. That response is generated by a model using context from the information retrieved by another model.

## Why is RAG important?

> Always remember a new approach comes only when there is a limitation. 

There is a limitation with the traditional LLM's. They generate response based solely on the data it is trained on. But for the response we may need *current information* as well as some *specific details* required for certain tasks. 

RAG addresses this limitation by incorporating a retrieval mechanism that allow the model to access external databases or documents in real-time. 

Eg. A financial model may be trained on last 52 weeks stocks data but to provide accurate response it is necessary for it know the current stock price too. 

## How does RAG work?

Steps: 
1. Information retrieved from the external knowledge source. [Retrieval]
2. Augmenting this information(context) with the user's query. [Augmenting]
3. Generating accurate and contextually relevant response using LLM. [Generation]

## What problems does RAG solve?

1. Factual Inaccuracies and Hallucinations
2. Outdated Information
3. Contextual Relevance
4. Domain-specific knowledge
5. Cost and Efficiency - Fine-tuning large models for specific tasks is expensive. RAG eliminates the need for retraining by dynamically retrieving relevant data, reducing costs and computational load.
6. Scalability across domains - RAG is adaptable to diverse industries, from healthcare to finance, without extensive retraining, making it highly scalable

## Challenges

1. **Complexity**: Combining retrieval and generation adds complexity to the model, requiring careful tuning and optimization to ensure both components work seamlessly together.
2. **Latency**: The retrieval step can introduce latency, making it challenging to deploy RAG models in real-time applications.
3. **Quality of Retrieval**: The overall performance of RAG heavily depends on the quality of the retrieved documents. Poor retrieval can lead to suboptimal generation, undermining the modelâ€™s effectiveness.
4. **Bias and Fairness**: Like other AI models, RAG can inherit biases present in the training data or retrieved documents, necessitating ongoing efforts to ensure fairness and mitigate biases.
