# Static Vs Dynamic Website

Website has its types too!

> Static - *"Jo Change na ho"* and Dynamic - *"Jo change ho"*. Simple!

## 1. Static Website

- A static website is made up of fixed resources i.e fixed html, css and js files.
- No backend code is run whenever a user visits. Content changes only when you redeploy after changing files.
- It can be hosted on Github Pages, Netlify, Vercel(with SSG), etc.
- It is fast, secure (no server logic required), and low cost.
- Eg. Portfolio, blog, landing page

## 2. Dynamic Website

- A dynamic website generates content on the fly based on user input, authentication, database content, etc. Hence, different users may see different data.
- HTML is generated per request, often using templates. (Eg. when you build website using React Js)
- It needs a server and database.
- Slower than static (due to runtime processing).
- Eg. Facebook, Twitter, Dashboards
