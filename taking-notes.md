# Taking notes

The process is a bit different depending on the medium.

Taking notes slows down quite a lot the amount of stuff I can ingest, but I found out it really helps me retain knowledge in the long-term. It allows me to come back, review and even share concepts that could be long forgotten otherwise, the slow intake trade-off is compensated.
